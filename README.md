# MechaCar Statistical Analysis
## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
I believe that the weight of the vehicle, length of the vehicle, spoiler angle, and the ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. We cannot assume the slope is 0 because all of the independent variables are not 0, in Figure 1. I would say yes, this linear model predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively due to the fact that all of these variables can effect the milage per gallon.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
In all three lots, the variance is below 100 pounds per square inch, as shown in Figure 2. However, lot 3 exceeds the 100 pounds per square inch shown in Figure 3. This can be due to a lot of things. The variance measures how far a set of numbers is spread out from their average, meaning that the PSI's average in lot 3 are a lot higher than the averages of lots 1 and 2.
