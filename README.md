## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
I believe that the weight of the vehicle, length of the vehicle, spoiler angle, and the ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. We cannot assume the slope is 0 because all of the independent variables are not 0, in Figure 1. I would say yes, this linear model predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively due to the fact that
